<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>
    An Atlas for Melanoma Precursors and a Pilot Atlas for Clonal Hematopoiesis
</h3>
<p>
    We are constructing a multi-dimensional atlas of pre-melanoma focused on
    understanding genetic and epigenetic events that transform melanocytes into
    invasive tumors. Melanoma is a cancer of increasing prevalence that is
    curable with minor surgery if detected early but life-threatening when it
    metastasizes. Melanomas metastasize when still small, making early detection
    essential but challenging. Our atlas will delineate the precise sequence of
    events leading up to pre-melanoma through detailed spatial analysis of
    cell-autonomous events such as oncogene mutation and non-autonomous events
    such as escape from immune surveillance. The atlas is based on
    highly-multiplexed tissue imaging and single cell sequencing and focused on
    samples in which the full sequence of events from atypia to invasive
    melanoma can be visualized in a single specimen. The atlas will serve as a
    publicly accessible resource for research scientists, physicians, and
    patients and improve our ability to (i) highlight lesions likely to progress
    to cancer, (ii) identify high-risk patients to inform decisions on surgery,
    (iii) identify low-risk patients to reduce unnecessary procedures, (iv)
    design improved procedures for routine screening of all individuals, and (v)
    inform treatment options when surgery is insufficient. Complementary studies
    with similar goals (but not supported by HTAN) are studying later stage
    melanomas.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>PETER SORGER, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/psorger.webp" />
    Dr. Peter Sorger, Otto Krayer Professor of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard
    Medical School, leads the PATCH Center and is director of a shared research
    laboratory (the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology; LSP) in which much of
    the PCA work is based. The LSP is a multi-investigator lab focused on
    improving the fundamental science used to develop therapeutic drugs,
    evaluate them in clinical trials, and identify patients most likely to
    benefit. Research in the Sorger lab focuses on mammalian signal transduction
    and oncogenesis in several types of cancer, including melanoma, using a mix
    of experimental and computational approaches. The laboratory developed the
    cyclic-immunofluorescence (CyCIF) method being used to construct the PCA
    pre-melanoma atlas as well as the software tools being used to analyze the
    resulting images, and the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) that is being
    used to manage PCA image data also was started in the lab. This pre-melanoma
    atlas is part of a larger digital histology effort, the Harvard Tissue
    Atlas, also led by Dr. Sorger.

<h3>SANDRO SANTAGATA, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/ssantagata.webp" />
    Dr. Sandro Santagata is an Associate Professor in Pathology at Harvard
    Medical School and a Neuropathologist in the Department of Pathology at
    Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Department of Oncologic Pathology at
    Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He is a member of the Ludwig Center at
    Harvard, the Harvard Program in Therapeutic Science (HiTS), and the HMS
    Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP). Dr. Santagata applies novel tissue
    imaging methods, including tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF),
    to understand the spatial and molecular phenotypes of human cancer. Using
    clinical trial specimens, he measures and models therapeutic responses in
    tumors and their microenvironment. Drs. Santagata and Sorger co-direct all
    aspects of the Harvard Tissue Atlas, of which the pre-melanoma atlas is an
    essential component.

<h3>JOHN ASTER, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/jaster.webp" />
    Dr. Jon Aster is the Chief of Hematopathology at the Brigham and Women’s
    Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-leads the Lymphoma and
    Myeloma Program of the pan-Harvard Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center
    (DF/HCC). He also serves as Director of the DF/HCC Specialized
    Histopathology Core Laboratory and is a member of the Harvard Ludwig Cancer
    Center. His research is focused on Notch signaling in T-cell acute
    lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and other cancers. Notch receptors
    participate in a signaling pathway that controls differentiation and other
    fundamental cellular processes in a context-specific fashion. The Aster lab
    has demonstrated that Notch signals can induce T-cell development from bone
    marrow progenitors and has shown that T-ALL cells depend on continued Notch
    signaling for growth. Dr. Aster is leading a pilot project in the PATCH
    Center to develop atlases of hematological pre-cancers and an effort to use
    multiplex tissue imaging data to improve medical education in pathology.
