<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy</h3>

<p>
    The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy is one of
    five research centers developing Pre-Cancer Atlases focused on unraveling
    the molecular underpinnings enabling the progression of pre-cancerous
    lesions to cancer. The Lung PCA is led by Dr. Avrum Spira (Boston
    University) and co-led by Dr. Steven Dubinett (University of California, Los
    Angeles), and Dr. Sarah Mazzilli (Boston University) in addition to
    collaborators across 10 institutions including: University of California Los
    Angeles; Stanford University; University of Colorado, Denver; MD Anderson
    Cancer Center; University College London; DFCI/Harvard University; Broad
    Institute; Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of
    Pennsylvania; and Vanderbilt University. The Lung PCA aims to build a
    high-resolution atlas characterizing the earliest cellular and molecular
    alterations in pre-cancerous lesions of the airway and lung, providing new
    opportunities for early cancer detection and novel targets to intercept the
    development of lung cancer. The atlas leverages unique retrospective and
    prospective cohorts assembled at multiple medical centers via our
    Biospecimen Unit, led by Daniel Merrick of the University of Colorado, to
    collect, annotate, and process premalignant lesion biospecimens of the lung
    and airway. Our Characterization Unit, led by Steven Dubinett of UCLA, will
    apply existing and emerging molecular profiling tools to characterize the
    genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions. Our Data
    Analysis Unit, led by Marc Lenburg of Boston University, will develop
    pipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality
    control, analysis and integration, leading to creation of a web-based portal
    for data dissemination and online integrative analysis to benefit the
    greater research community.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>AVRUM SPIRA, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/aspira.webp" width="128" height="161" />
    Dr. Avrum Spira is a Professor of Medicine, Pathology, and Bioinformatics,
    and the Alexander Graham Bell Professor in Health Care Entrepreneurship at
    Boston University. He is founding Chief of the Division of Computational
    Biomedicine in the Department of Medicine, attends in the Medical Intensive
    Care Unit at Boston Medical Center, and directs the Translational
    Bioinformatics Program in the Clinical and Translational Science Institute
    at Boston University. He has recently been named global head of the new Lung
    Cancer Initiative within Johnson & Johnson and Director of the Johnson &
    Johnson Innovation Lung Cancer Center at Boston University. Dr. Spira has
    built a translational research program that focuses on genomic alterations
    associated with smoking-related lung disease, leading to a molecular test
    for the early detection of lung cancer (PerceptaTM) that has successfully
    translated into the clinic as well as a novel therapeutic for COPD that is
    in preclinical development.

<h3>STEVEN DUBINETT, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/sdubinett.webp" width="128" height="161" />
    Dr. Steven M. Dubinett is Director of the University of California, Los
    Angeles (UCLA) Clinical & Translational Science Institute (CTSI), Associate
    Vice Chancellor, and Senior Associate Dean for Translational Research. He
    oversees the translation of UCLA biomedical discoveries into medical
    products and health interventions and is responsible for the efficient
    integration of the research infrastructure through the CTSI. He is currently
    Chair of the Executive Committee of UC Biomedical Research Acceleration,
    Integration, and Development (UC BRAID), which integrates clinical and
    translational research across the University of California. Dr. Dubinett has
    extensive experience in translational investigation, academic
    administration, mentorship, and peer review. He previously served as
    Director for Biomarker Development for the American College of Surgeons
    Oncology Group, directing biospecimen utilization in the context of clinical
    trials. Dr. Dubinett currently serves as the Chair of the Research
    Evaluation Panel for biospecimen utilization for the American College of
    Radiology Imaging Network/ National Lung Screening Trial.
