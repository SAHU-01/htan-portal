<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>
    Transition to Metastatic State: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and Brain
    Metastasis
</h3>
<p>
    Metastasis embodies the whole-organism pathophysiology of cancer. The spread
    of cancer cells beyond the primary tumor site is responsible for the
    majority of cancer deaths and is the most overt expression of cancer’s
    complex evolutionary dynamics. Intimately related to the intricate processes
    of development and immunity, the transition from locally invasive to
    metastatic cancer also poses a major scientific hurdle. Recent technological
    and computational advancements enable dynamic, multidimensional, multiplanar
    analysis of multiple tissues. We are applying these advances to clinical
    samples with the aim of generating a high-resolution spatiotemporal tissue
    atlas of the most lethal cancers in the United States: lung cancer,
    pancreatic cancer, and metastases of the central nervous system. Our
    approach is to obtain high-quality human biospecimens from surgical
    resections, biopsy, or autopsy of primary and disseminated tumors. Samples
    are interrogated using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing as well
    as spatially informative multiplexed molecular profiling using protein and
    RNA in situ hybridization–based technologies. Integration, analysis, and
    presentation of these datasets will be undertaken with the goal of
    generating human tumor atlases of value to the entire cancer research
    community.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>DANA PE’ER, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/dpeer.webp" />
    Dr. Dana Pe’er is Chair of the Computational and Systems Biology Program and
    Scientific Director of The Alan and Sandra Gerry Metastasis and Tumor
    Ecosystems Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She develops
    novel computational methods to characterize regulatory circuit dynamics at
    the single-cell level in the context of complex tissues such as the tumor
    microenvironment. She received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Hebrew
    University of Jerusalem and trained as a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. George
    Church at Harvard University. Dr. Pe’er has been recognized with a number of
    honors including a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award, an NIH Director’s
    New Innovator Award, an NIH Director’s Pioneer Award, and the Packard
    Fellowship in Science and Engineering. She currently serves on the editorial
    board of the journal Cell and the organizing committee of the Human Cell
    Atlas project, co-leading computational analysis for this project.

<h3>CHRISTINE IACOBUZIO-DONAHUE, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/idonahue.webp" />
    Dr. Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue is a board-certified Anatomic Pathologist
    with specialty training in gastrointestinal pathology and cancer genetics.
    She currently serves as an Attending Physician in Pathology, Director of the
    David M. Rubenstein Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research, and Director of
    the Last Wish Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Her lab
    employs a variety of models and methods, including a strong emphasis on
    genomic and bioinformatics analyses of human primary and metastatic
    pancreatic cancer tissues obtained from rapid autopsies, mouse models of
    pancreatic cancer, and, most recently, the development of a long-term
    evolutionary model system for functional analyses of clonal evolution and
    adaptive mechanisms. Dr. Iacobuzio-Donahue is the recipient of an R35
    Outstanding Investigator Award and maintains a collaboration with the
    American Museum of Natural History funded by the Kleberg Foundation to
    develop novel tools and analytics for the evolutionary biology of cancer.
