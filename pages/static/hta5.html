<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer</h3>
<p>
    The majority of patients die from cancer because their tumors either do not
    respond to therapy or eventually develop resistance to the treatments. The
    Boston Human Tumor Atlas Network Research Center includes research
    institutions in Boston, Stanford, and Princeton that are mapping the cell
    types in breast cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer. The resulting tumor
    atlases will generate spatial and single-cell resolution information to
    provide an unprecedented understanding of the malignant, immune, and stromal
    cellular and tissue compartments that drive intrinsic and acquired
    resistance to existing and emerging therapeutics. These compartments then
    can be used to inform patient stratification and new treatment strategies
    and to make precision cancer medicine a reality. This detailed information
    is essential for the targeted therapies (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibition) and
    immunotherapies (e.g., anti-PD-1 therapies) we are examining, because these
    therapies typically benefit only a subset of patients treated with them for
    a limited period of time, and mechanisms of resistance to them are thus far
    poorly understood. Our studies will help develop both new insights to
    identify patients at risk of resistance to their cancer therapies and new
    treatment strategies to overcome both de novo and acquired resistance,
    ultimately improving the outcome for patients with cancer.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>BRUCE JOHNSON, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/bjohnson.webp" />
    Dr. Bruce Johnson is the Chief Clinical Research Officer at the Dana-Farber
    Cancer Institute and has organized and run clinical trials for more than 30
    years. His translational research is devoted to testing novel therapeutic
    agents for their efficacy against lung cancer and other malignancies with
    specific genomic changes and the effects of the tumor microenvironment on
    efficacy of immunotherapy. Dr. Johnson was one of the scientists who
    discovered the association between epidermal growth factor receptor
    mutations and response to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase
    inhibitors. As the Director of the Center for Precision Medicine at the
    Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, he oversees the characterization of tumor
    specimens from patients both before and after therapy with chemotherapeutic
    agents, targeted agents, and immunotherapy. Dr. Johnson is a Professor of
    Medicine at Harvard Medical School, an Institute Physician at the
    Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Past
    President of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

<h3>AVIV REGEV, Ph.D.</h3>

    <img class="headshot" src="/aregev.webp" />
    Dr. Aviv Regev’s research centers on understanding how complex molecular
    circuits function in cells and between cells in tissues. She is a professor
    in the Department of Biology at MIT, Chair of the Faculty and founding
    director of the Klarman Cell Observatory and Cell Circuits Program at the
    Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is a core member, and an
    Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her lab has been a
    single-cell genomics pioneer – inventing key experimental methods and
    computational algorithms in the field, demonstrating their application, and
    inferring the molecular and cellular circuits that control cellular and
    tissue function in health and disease. She also is Founding Co-Chair of the
    international initiative to build a Human Cell Atlas (HCA), whose mission is
    to create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells – the fundamental
    units of life – as a basis for understanding human health and diagnosing,
    monitoring, and treating disease.
