    An alpha version of the Data Portal can be found at

<p>
    Atlas datasets generated by the HTAN Research Centers and pilot projects
    will be made available to the public via scheduled releases that we expect
    to begin in late 2019 or 2020. Detailed information about upcoming data
    releases will be provided here once it is available.
</p>

<p>
    In anticipation of our first data release, the tables below summarize the
    types of experimental data being generated by each of the atlas teams across
    the specified tissue and tumor types and patient populations.

    Figure 4. Key Tumors Studied by the Consortium HTAN centers will generate 3D
    atlases of human tumors spanning different tissue types across adult and
    pediatric tumors from patients with pre-cancer, primary tumors, and
    metastases, as well as resistant tumors before and after treatment.
    Projected ranges for the number of samples to be profiled over the 5-year
    HTAN period are depicted for each center and tumor type. In some cases,
    multiple samples will be profiled from the same patient. HTAN includes the
    following centers: Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Dana-Farber
    Cancer Institute (DFCI), Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU),
    Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), Duke University School of
    Medicine, Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP), Human Tumor Pilot Project
    (HTAPP), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), Stanford University,
    Boston University (BU), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSCKK), and
    Harvard Medical School (HMS).
