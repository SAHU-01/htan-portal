<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>
    Multi-omic Characterization of Transformation of Familial Adenomatous
    Polyposis
</h3>
<p>
    We have established a state-of-the-art PreCancer Altas (PCA) for colorectal
    cancer (CRC) using Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) as a model system.
    CRC is one of the leading causes of death in the United States with 140,000
    new cases arising each year. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli
    (APC) gene are thought to be one of the early events in sporadic colorectal
    cancer. FAP families have inherited mutations in APC, and affected
    individuals classically develop hundreds of polyps, which often progress to
    invasive colon cancer by the third decade of life. Due to the
    extraordinarily high number of polyps that can be obtained from a single
    individual, FAP is an ideal disease system to study the host factors driving
    molecular heterogeneity in precancerous lesions. We expect these studies to
    inform diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic measures for sporadic CRC.
    In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the early events that
    lead to and drive CRC, we will construct a PreCancer Atlas of the
    pre-cancerous polyps, early adenocarcinoma, and nearby normal tissue
    isolated from FAP patients. To build this atlas and execute this project, we
    have assembled an expert team of investigators with extensive experience
    working in large consortia. Together, we have already developed pipelines
    for multi-omics and imaging characterization, biospecimen collection, and
    analysis that we have leveraged for FAP samples.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>MICHAEL SNYDER, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/msnyder.webp" />
    Dr. Michael Snyder is the Stanford Ascherman Professor and Chair of Genetics
    and the Director of the Center of Genomics and Personalized Medicine. Dr.
    Snyder received his Ph.D. training at the California Institute of Technology
    and did his postdoc at Stanford University. He is a leader in the field of
    functional genomics and proteomics and one of the leaders of ENCODE. His
    laboratory was the first to perform a large-scale functional genomics
    project in any organism and has developed many technologies in genomics and
    proteomics including high-resolution tiling arrays for the entire human
    genome, methods for global mapping of transcription factor binding sites,
    paired-end sequencing for mapping of structural variation in eukaryotes, de
    novo genome sequencing of genomes using high-throughput technologies, and
    RNA-Seq. These technologies have been used for characterizing genomes,
    proteomes, and regulatory networks.

<h3>JAMES FORD, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/jford.webp" />
    Dr. James Ford is a medical oncologist and geneticist at Stanford and is
    devoted to studying the genetic basis of breast and GI cancer development,
    treatment, and prevention. Dr. Ford graduated from Yale University, where he
    later received his M.D. He was an internal medicine resident, Clinical
    Fellow in Medical Oncology, and Research Fellow of Biological Sciences at
    Stanford, and he joined the faculty in 1998. He is currently Professor of
    Medicine and Genetics and Director of the Stanford Cancer Genetics Clinic
    and the Cancer Genomics Program. Dr. Ford’s research goals are to understand
    the role of genetic changes in cancer genes in the development of cancer. He
    studies the role of the p53 and BRCA1 tumor suppressor genes in DNA repair
    and uses high-throughput genomic analyses of cancer to identify molecular
    signatures for targeted therapies. Dr. Ford’s clinical interests include the
    diagnosis and treatment of patients with a hereditary predisposition to
    cancer.

<h3>CHRISTINA CURTIS, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/ccurtis.webp" />
    Trained in molecular and computational biology and jointly appointed in
    Medicine and Genetics, Dr. Christina Curtis pursues systems biology and
    computational approaches to establish a quantitative and mechanistic
    understanding of cancer progression. Her research is focused on the
    development and application of innovative experimental and computational
    approaches to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and earlier detection of
    cancer by leveraging genome-scale data derived from clinical samples coupled
    with computational modeling and iterative experimentation. To this end, Dr.
    Curtis and her team have developed an integrated experimental and
    computational framework to measure clinically relevant patient-specific
    parameters and to measure clonal dynamics during tumor progression and
    through therapy. This led to their description of a Big Bang model of
    effectively neutral tumor evolution, thereby advancing a quantitative
    understanding of tumor progression and refining the de facto clonal
    evolution model.

<h3>WILLIAM GREENLEAF, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/wgreenleaf.webp" />
    Dr. William Greenleaf studies the physical genome both by investigating the
    relationship between the folding of DNA in the nucleus and gene expression
    regulation, as well as the relationship between DNA sequence and the
    structure and function of encoded biomolecules.
