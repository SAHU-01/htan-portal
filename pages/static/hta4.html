<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Center for Pediatric Tumor Cell Atlas</h3>
<p>
    Because cancers in children are highly distinct from those in adults, the
    causes, mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from
    the study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers
    requires the specific study of pediatric cancers. This project will
    characterize three specific subtypes of pediatric malignancies, which
    together account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade
    glioma (pHGG), high risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute
    lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All three tumor types
    share the characteristic of typically exhibiting an initial response to
    therapy followed by the emergence of resistance and refractory disease. We
    will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells, the
    microenvironment, and the immune system using comprehensive
    multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ technologies associated with two
    critical and high-priority transitions: initial response and emergence of
    resistant disease. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy,
    molecularly-targeted therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell
    therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer therapy. The final
    products of this project will include publically available atlases of
    comprehensive multi-omic, single-cell analysis, critical computational tools
    and pipelines, and banked biospecimens available to the research community
    for follow-up studies.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>KAI TAN, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/ktan.webp" />
    Dr. Kai Tan is a systems biologist and Associate Professor in the Department
    of Pediatrics, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of
    Pennsylvania. He has extensive experience studying transcriptional and
    epigenetic regulation in normal development and oncogenesis through a
    combination of experimental genomics and computational models. Dr. Tan’s
    laboratory has developed a number of approaches for modeling transcriptional
    regulatory networks, which have been used to dissect the gene regulatory
    networks controlling embryonic hematopoiesis, T cell differentiation, and
    leukemogenesis. In addition, his group has pioneered a number of popular
    computational algorithms for constructing models of transcriptional
    regulatory networks by integrating multi-dimensional genomic, epigenomic,
    and transcriptomic datasets. The ultimate goal of his work is to understand
    dynamic molecular networks, the role of combinatorial epigenetic
    modifications and transcriptional regulation, and the role of 3-D genomic
    organization in gene regulation to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
    cancer patients.

<h3>STEPHEN P. HUNGER, M.D</h3>

    Dr. Stephen P. Hunger is a pediatric oncologist and Chief of the Division of
    Oncology, Director of the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at The
    Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania. His
    research is focused on improving understanding of the molecular genetics of
    childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and translating new discoveries
    into improved outcomes via clinical trials and linked translational studies.
    As Vice Chair (2002-2007) and Chair of the Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
    ALL Committee (2008-2015), he was responsible for overseeing the design and
    conduct of clinical trials and translational research studies that enroll
    over 70% of children in the United States with ALL. Dr. Hunger was Principal
    Investigator of the COG High Risk ALL TARGET Project, which has revealed new
    sentinel genetic lesions in childhood ALL, identified the Ph-like ALL high
    risk ALL subtype, and defined its genomic landscape, all of which are
    discoveries that have led to additional trials testing molecularly targeted
    therapies.
