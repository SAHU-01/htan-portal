        over 500 images in Minerva.
    </li>

    <li>
        100 cases with new scRNASeq data of which 62 have level 3 and higher
        available for download, allowing for download and analysis of scRNASeq
        data from over 150 cases and 250 biospecimens.
    </li>

    <li>
        1 case with both bulk DNASeq and RNASeq, which can now be explored in
