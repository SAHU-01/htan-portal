        >RFA-CA-21-037: 3D technologies to Accelerate HTAN Atlas Building
        Efforts</a
    >
</p>

<h4>Datasets</h4>
<p>
    The ten HTAN Research Centers and two pilot projects are generating a
    variety of datasets both as part of the development of Research
    Center-specific cancer atlases and as part of Trans-Network Projects
    involving multiple HTAN teams. Atlas datasets will include raw and processed
    data, clinical data, and biospecimen, experimental, and analytical metadata.
</p>
<p>
    Atlas datasets will be disseminated to the public through the HTAN Data
    Coordinating Center and/or NCI-funded data repositories beginning in late
    2019 or 2020. Please see our
    <a href="https://humantumoratlas.org/dashboard/">Dashboard </a>page for more
    information on the types of experimental data being generated by each atlas
    team.
</p>

<h4>Metadata and Clinical Data Standards</h4>
<p>
    Multiple Working Groups made up of HTAN members, NCI staff, and participants
    in related consortia are in the process of developing metadata and clinical
    data standards for HTAN that will capture the full depth and complexity of
    atlas datasets and will facilitate dataset discovery and integration. Rather
    than develop new standards, HTAN Working Groups are aiming to adopt and, as
    needed, adapt and expand upon the efforts of related initiatives, such as
    the Human Cell Atlas and the Genomic Data Commons. The resulting HTAN
    standards will ensure that atlas datasets are extensively and consistently
    annotated regarding sample and disease characteristics as well as
    methodological approaches. At the same time, HTAN standards will ensure that
    these datasets are discoverable and accessible for scientific discovery
    within the larger cancer data ecosystem. All HTAN standards will be released
    to the public as they become available.
</p>

<h4>Experimental and Analytical Methods</h4>
<p>
    HTAN is committed to the development and dissemination to the scientific
    community of novel experimental and analytical methods and tools for both
    established and emerging experimental modalities. Network members are
    leveraging <a href="https://protocols.io">Protocols.io</a> for collaborative
    development and &#8211; in the future &#8211; public release of protocols,
    such as SOPs for biospecimen handling and processing. Additional community
    resources, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and
    <a href="https://dockstore.org/">Dockstore</a>, will be used for the release
    of computational code and analytical tools created as part of the HTAN
    initiative.
