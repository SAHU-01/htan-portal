<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Human Tumor Atlas Pilot Project (HTAPP)</h3>

<p>
    To diagnose, study, monitor, and treat human cancer, there is an enormous
    need to define and characterize the cells that comprise tumors, chart their
    spatial organization, and decipher their functional connections. The
    generation of tumor atlases poses substantial challenges, including
    development and dissemination of robust SOPs for tissue collection,
    development of experimental design strategies, establishment of strategies
    to integrate across cellular and spatial data, and development of effective
    data sharing approaches.
</p>

<p>
    To address these challenges and lay a foundation for HTAN, HTAPP was
    initiated in partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the
    Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR). HTAPP aims to:
    (1) gain an understanding of the number of cells, tumors, and spatial
    methods required to describe tumor heterogeneity; (2) develop, validate, and
    transfer knowledge of SOPs for tissue procurement, sampling parameters, and
    data generation and analysis from seven tumor types; (3) generate
    pilot-scale, spatially resolved tumor atlases of metastatic breast cancer
    and pediatric neuroblastoma; (4) provide data and resources generated to the
    HTAN and broader community; and (5) assess the feasibility of applying
    single-cell genomics to FFPE tissues. Our team is composed of clinical,
    single-cell genomics, spatial genomics and proteomics, and computation
    experts, who have pioneered the development and application of these
    approaches to tumors.

<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>

<h3>AVIV REGEV, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/aregev.png" />
    Dr. Aviv Regev’s research centers on understanding how complex molecular
    circuits function in cells and between cells in tissues. She is a professor
    in the Department of Biology at MIT, Chair of the Faculty and founding
    director of the Klarman Cell Observatory and Cell Circuits Program at the
    Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is a core member, and an
    Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Her lab has been a
    single-cell genomics pioneer – inventing key experimental methods and
    computational algorithms in the field, demonstrating their application, and
    inferring the molecular and cellular circuits that control cellular and
    tissue function in health and disease. She is Founding Co-Chair of the
    international initiative to build a Human Cell Atlas (HCA), whose mission is
    to create comprehensive reference maps of all human cells – the fundamental
    units of life – as a basis for understanding human health and diagnosing,
    monitoring, and treating disease.

<h3>ORIT ROZENBLATT-ROSEN, Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/orozenblatt.png" />
    Dr. Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen is Scientific Director of the Klarman Cell
    Observatory at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the lead scientist
    at the Broad for the international Human Cell Atlas Initiative. Dr.
    Rozenblatt-Rosen has a background in cancer research, epigenetics, systems
    biology, genomics, and single-cell genomics. She helped develop and
    implement systematic pipelines for genomic profiling and analysis of single
    cells from freshly dissected tumors. Previously, Dr. Rozenblatt-Rosen was a
    research scientist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. She led a team that
    performed systematic analyses of host network perturbations induced by DNA
    tumor viruses to help interpret cancer genomes. As a postdoctoral fellow at
    the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she focused on understanding the links
    between tumor suppression and epigenetic mechanisms. Dr. Rozenblatt-Rosen
    earned a B.S. in Biology from Tel Aviv University and a Ph.D. from the
    Weizmann Institute of Science.

<h3>BRUCE JOHNSON, M.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/bjohnson.png" />
    Dr. Bruce Johnson is the Chief Clinical Research Officer at the Dana-Farber
    Cancer Institute and has organized and run clinical trials for more than 30
    years. His translational research is devoted to testing novel therapeutic
    agents for their efficacy against lung cancer and other malignancies with
    specific genomic changes and the effects of the tumor microenvironment on
    efficacy of immunotherapy. Dr. Johnson was one of the scientists who
    discovered the association between epidermal growth factor receptor
    mutations and response to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase
    inhibitors. As the Director of the Center for Precision Medicine at the
    Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, he oversees the characterization of tumor
    specimens from patients both before and after therapy with chemotherapeutic
    agents, targeted agents, and immunotherapy. Dr. Johnson is a Professor of
    Medicine at Harvard Medical School, an Institute Physician at the
    Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Past President of the
    American Society of Clinical Oncology.

<h3>MARIO SUVÀ, M.D., Ph.D.</h3>

<p>
    <img class="headshot" src="/msuva.png" />
    Dr. Mario Suvà is a physician-scientist in the Department of Pathology at
    Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and an institute member at the Broad
    Institute. Dr. Suvà’s expertise is in clinical neuropathology, single-cell
    sequencing technology, and cancer research. Dr. Suvà co-directed landmark
    studies characterizing glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, and
    pediatric gliomas with single-cell genomic technologies, shedding light on
    tumor heterogeneity, tumor classification, glioma cell lineages, cancer stem
    cell programs, tumor evolution, and the composition of the tumor
    microenvironment. His laboratory focuses on dissecting the heterogeneity of
    patient tumors and relating transcriptional and genetic programs of
    individual cancer cells. Dr. Suvà earned his M.D. and Ph.D. from the
    University of Lausanne, Switzerland. His doctoral research identified cancer
    stem cells in Ewing sarcoma and highlighted mechanisms underlying their
    emergence. He conducted postdoctoral research at MGH and the Broad
    Institute, applying chromatin analysis and functional approaches to identify
    master regulators of glioma stem cell programs.
